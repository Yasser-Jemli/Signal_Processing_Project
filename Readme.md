# Signal Processing Project

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for a signal processing project aimed to get you started with signal processing topics and techniques.

## Features
- Audio Processing , MFCC , GMM , CNN , Speechreconizition , Audo _ compression 


## Getting Started
in this repo you will find a lot of usefull ressources about signal processing techniques and topics , also we will have a review and code review of signal processing book 
Noting that the repo is still under construction and may need same fixes and correction so feel free to raise an issue and thanks in advance 

## Review of "Hands-on Signal Analysis with Python" & "Simulation with Python"

As part of this project, I found the book *Hands-on Signal Analysis with Python* by Thomas Haslwanter to be an invaluable resource. This book delves deep into signal processing techniques and thier implementation with python . The clear explanations and practical examples provided in the book greatly contributed to my understanding and implementation of signal processing techniques for this project.
