Audio Processing and Recording Description:
This project provides a set of functions to record audio from a microphone, apply noise reduction, and enhance the voice using Python. It utilizes the pyaudio, numpy, matplotlib, scipy libraries for audio processing and visualization. The main script main() function orchestrates the audio recording and processing pipeline. Features:

    Record audio from the microphone and save it to a WAV file.
    Apply a basic noise gate for noise reduction.
    Equalize the voice using a high-pass filter.
    Display and save the raw, noise-reduced, and voice-enhanced audio signals as figures.
    Save the processed audio to a WAV file.

Usage:

    Ensure the required libraries are installed: pyaudio, numpy, matplotlib, scipy.
    Run the main() function to initiate the audio recording and processing.

How to Use:

    Clone the project repository.
    Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
    Run the main() function to start the audio recording and processing.
